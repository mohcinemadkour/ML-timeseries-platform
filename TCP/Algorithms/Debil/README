## compile debil
gcc debil.c -o debil -Wall -lm -O4

# on a mac, you might need to comment out the line: #include <values.h> // For MAXFLOAT


## preparing the photometry file for Debil

import fiteb
e = fiteb.EB()
e._make_intable(int(dotastroid))

## this will make a file called Phot/dotastro<dotastroid>.dat
## see Phot/dotastro220107.dat
## the format is time (UJD)  mag mag_err


## then prepare a script with:
## filename   period
## e.g. cat test.in:
## Phot/dotastro220107.dat 2.43648439


## then run debil
./debil test.in test.out test.err 8000

There's a .data and .fit file written to the top directory with the phased data and the resultant fit:
